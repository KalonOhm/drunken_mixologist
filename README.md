# TODO: Add project summary
<!-- Goal of project is to gather mixed-drink ingredients (alcohol, bitters, syrups, garnishes, etc) then, when called, randomly produce a new "mixed-drink" that could conceivably be created, no matter how bad it may sound. Idea came up while watching a Youtube channel called "How to Drink", with a series of videos in which the host pulled supposedly real orders purchased by patrons at his bar, orders which sounded strange, bad, or just uncommon. He would then try to create his interpretation of that drink order, and taste-test ist. Some where understandibly awful, but some surprised himself with their quality and flavor. Sounded like a funny idea when I heard about this project. -->
# TODO: CLI Feature 1
<!-- Login/authentication feature similar to the example -->
# TODO: CLI Feature 2
<!-- Choose "surprise me" or enter alcohol type in the CLI to begin. either all random, or prompting the user whether they want, in succession, a second alcohol, a bitters, syrup, garnish, ice, etc, randomly assign a respective ingredient to the recipe, possibly give it a random name too? -->
<!-- think I'll try the Faraday thing, found an API on thecocktaildb.com/api.php, and haven't had luck finding a good website to scrape instead.  -->
# TODO: CLI Feature 3
<!-- give option to save drinks to favorites?  -->
<!-- 
Optional
Scrape data using Nokogiri/open-uri
Incorporate a login/logout system using BCrypt
Send requests to an API to capture data using Faraday -->


TODO: Delete this and the text below, and describe your gem

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/drunken_mixologist`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

TODO: Replace `UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_PRIOR_TO_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG` with your gem name right after releasing it to RubyGems.org. Please do not do it earlier due to security reasons. Alternatively, replace this section with instructions to install your gem from git if you don't plan to release to RubyGems.org.

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_PRIOR_TO_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_PRIOR_TO_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
