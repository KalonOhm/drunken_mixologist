# TODO: Add project summary
<!-- Goal of project is to gather mixed-drink ingredients (alcohol, bitters, syrups, garnishes, etc) then, when called, randomly produce a new "mixed-drink" that could conceivably be created, no matter how bad it may sound. Idea came up while watching a Youtube channel called "How to Drink", with a series of videos in which the host pulled supposedly real orders purchased by patrons at his bar, orders which sounded strange, bad, or just uncommon. He would then try to create his interpretation of that drink order, and taste-test ist. Some where understandibly awful, but some surprised himself with their quality and flavor. Sounded like a funny idea when I heard about this project. -->

<!-- Login/authentication feature similar to the example -->
# TODO: CLI Feature 2
<!-- Choose "surprise me" or enter alcohol type in the CLI to begin. either all random, or prompting the user whether they want, in succession, a second alcohol, a bitters, syrup, garnish, ice, etc, randomly assign a respective ingredient to the recipe, possibly give it a random name too? -->
<!-- think I'll try the Faraday thing, found an API on thecocktaildb.com/api.php, and haven't had luck finding a good website to scrape instead.  -->
# TODO: CLI Feature 3
<!-- give option to save drinks to favorites?  -->
<!-- 
Optional
Scrape data using Nokogiri/open-uri
Incorporate a login/logout system using BCrypt
Send requests to an API to capture data using Faraday -->
